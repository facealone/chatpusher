<h1>Chat Pusher</h1>
<p><em>Chat Pusher</em> is a service allowing you to have messages posted using <strong>HTTP</strong>, <strong>email</strong> or <strong>XMPP</strong>
broadcasted to one or more <a href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP">XMPP</a> receivers.</p>

<h2>Setting up a broadcast address</h2>
<p><em>Chat Pusher</em> manages addresses of the kind <em>${name}@chatpusher.appspotchat.com</em>. To claim an XMPP address (first-come, first-served)
and start using it, add the desired address as an XMPP buddy and send "/claim" to it. Unless the name was already taken (in which case you will be informed about it),
you are now the owner and the single member of the address.</p>
<p>As an owner, you may issue the following administrative commands:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>/token</dt><dd>Write out the current secret token (used with broadcasting over HTTP and email, see below).</dd>
	<dt>/newtoken</dt><dd>Generate a new token and replace the current one.</dd>
	<dt>/add &lt;newmember-email-address&gt;</dt><dd>Add a new member to those receiving broadcasts. An invitation will be sent but messages will not be
					  received by the new member until he adds the chat list as a buddy. If the specified email
					  is already a member of the chat list an invitation will be sent again.</dd>
	<dt>/remove &lt;membertoremove-email-address&gt;</dt><dd>Remove a member from the chat list.</dd>
	<dt>/info</dt><dd>Get information on the owner and members of the list. This command may also be issued by regular members (not just the owner).</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Broadcasting using XMPP</h2>
<p>Every message sent to <em>${name}@chatpusher.appspotchat.com</em> by one of its members will be automatically broadcasted (with a signature) to all members.
This is obviously only useful if you have more then one member.</p> 

<h2>Broadcasting using HTTP</h2>
<p>To broadcast a message to a chat list issue a GET or POST to the URL <strong>https://chatpusher.appspot.com/broadcast</strong> with the following parameters:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>list</dt><dd>The name of the list to broadcast to.</dd>
	<dt>secret_token</dt><dd>The secret token (see the /token and /newtoken commands above).</dd>
	<dt>payload</dt><dd>The message text to broadcast.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Examples using curl:</p>
<pre>curl -d list=mylist -d secret_token=68de5ebf-f5d1-49df-9fef-f8d1a089838f -d payload=HelloWorld http://chatpusher.appspot.com/broadcast
./my_script_generating_output | curl -d list=test -d secret_token=68de5ebf-f5d1-49df-9fef-f8d1a089838f --data-urlencode payload@- http://chatpusher.appspot.com/broadcast</pre>

<h2>Broadcasting using mail</h2>
<p>To broadcast a message using mail send a message to the address <em>${name}+${secret_token}@chatpusher.appspotmail.com</em>.</p>
